Parameter sorting:

1. G: 		global coupling scaling factor
2. w_EE_bias:   strength of E->E synapses (may be scaled by heterogeneity_scale if specified)
3. w_EI_bias:   strength of E->I synapses (may be scaled by heterogeneity_scale if specified)
4. J_i:		the initial J_i value -- will be used if no FIC tuning is done
5. J_i_scale: adjust best J_i in each node (from FIC output) by this ratio
6. heterogeneity_scale: if heterogeneity file exists, scale w_EE_bias and w_EI_bias by (1 + heterogeneity_map[j] * heterogeneity_scale)
7. time_steps:  simulation time steps in ms
8. BOLD_TR:  	TR of the simulated BOLD data in ms
9. trans_v:    transmission velocity in m/s. For instantaneous transmission set to a large value (like 999999.99)
10. seed:     	seed for random number generator
