Parameter sorting:

1. nodes: 	the number of nodes
2. G: 		global coupling scaling factor
3. J_NMDA_bias: 	strength of NMDA coupling (may be scaled by heterogeneity_scale if specified)
4. w_plus:	strength of excitatory recurrence
5. J_i:		the initial J_i value -- will be overwritten by J_i tuning
6. sigma: 	noise level
7. time_steps:  simulation time steps in ms
8. FIC_len: 	length of the time window for which average firing rates are computed during FIC in ms. Experience shows that it shouldn't be shorter than 10000 ms.
9. BOLD_TR:  	TR of the simulated BOLD data in ms
10. trans_v:    transmission velocity in m/s. For instantaneous transmission set to a large value (like 999999.99)
11. seed:     	seed for random number generator
12. J_i_scale: adjust best J_i in each node (from FIC output) by this ratio
13. heterogeneity_scale: if heterogeneity file exists, scale J_NMDA by (1 + heterogeneity_map[j] * heterogeneity_scale)
